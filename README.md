# STunnel Docker Container
From the [stunnel website](https://www.stunnel.org/):
> stunnel is an open-source multi-platform application used to provide a 
> universal TLS/SSL tunneling service. stunnel can be used to provide secure 
> encrypted connections for clients or servers that do not speak TLS or SSL 
> natively

## Examples
### Allow Local Insecure Clients to Connect to PKI-Secured SSL/TLS Server
These examples show how you would proxy Redis clients that do not support 
TLS/SSL to a TLS-secured Redis server on Azure (should apply similarly to AWS).

#### Using the Default Root Certificate Chain
This example uses the default trusted root CA chain from Alpine Linux:

```bash
docker run -itd \
    -e STUNNEL_CLIENT=yes \
    -e STUNNEL_SERVICE=redis \
    -e STUNNEL_ACCEPT=6379 \
    -e STUNNEL_CONNECT=myredis.redis.cache.windows.net:6380 \
    -e STUNNEL_CHECK_HOST=myredis.redis.cache.windows.net \
    -e STUNNEL_VERIFY_CHAIN=yes \
    -p 6379:6379 \
    inveniem/stunnel
```

#### Using a Custom Root Certificate Chain
This example shows how to provide your own trusted root certificate chain:

```bash
docker run -itd \
    -e STUNNEL_CLIENT=yes \
    -e STUNNEL_SERVICE=redis \
    -e STUNNEL_ACCEPT=6379 \
    -e STUNNEL_CONNECT=myredis.redis.cache.windows.net:6380 \
    -e STUNNEL_CHECK_HOST=myredis.redis.cache.windows.net \
    -e STUNNEL_VERIFY_CHAIN=yes \
    -p 6379:6379 \
    -v /etc/ssl/private/ca-certificates.crt:/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt:ro \
    inveniem/stunnel
```

This loads the custom certificate chain from
`/etc/ssl/private/ca-certificates.crt` on the host system into 
`/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` in the container, which is the default 
location the container looks for the certificates. The location within the 
container can be overridden by setting the `STUNNEL_CAFILE` environment 
variable.

### Wrap Local Server for PKI-Secured SSL/TLS Client Connections
These examples show you would secure an LDAP server running in a container 
named `directory` so that clients can connect to it over LDAPS.

#### Self-signed Certificate
```bash
docker run -itd --name ldaps --link directory:ldap \
    -e STUNNEL_SERVICE=ldaps \
    -e STUNNEL_ACCEPT=636 \
    -e STUNNEL_CONNECT=ldap:389 \
    -p 636:636 \
    inveniem/stunnel
```

This will automatically generate a self-signed certificate that expires in 365 
days.

#### Custom Certificate
```bash
docker run -itd --name ldaps --link directory:ldap \
    -e STUNNEL_SERVICE=ldaps \
    -e STUNNEL_ACCEPT=636 \
    -e STUNNEL_CONNECT=ldap:389 \
    -p 636:636 \
    -v /etc/ssl/private/server.key:/etc/stunnel/stunnel.key:ro \
    -v /etc/ssl/private/server.crt:/etc/stunnel/stunnel.pem:ro \
    inveniem/stunnel
```

This accomplishes the following:
- Loads the server private key from `/etc/ssl/private/server.key` on the host 
system into `/etc/stunnel/stunnel.key` in the container, which is the default 
location the container looks for the key. The location within the container can 
be overridden by setting the `STUNNEL_KEY` environment variable.

- Loads the server certificate from `/etc/ssl/private/server.crt` on the host 
system into `/etc/stunnel/stunnel.pem` in the container, which is the default 
location the container looks for the certificate. The location within the 
container can be overridden by setting the `STUNNEL_CRT` environment variable.

#### Using a Custom Cipher List
By default, the container configures `stunnel` to use only ciphers indicated as 
"Modern" by [Mozilla's SSL Configuration Generator](https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/)
(as of 2024-03-24).

For a variety of reasons, including a desire for more security, a need for 
compatibility with legacy systems and/or a delay in getting updates from 
vendors, this default may not work for everyone's needs. 

This example shows how to provide your own list of allowed ciphers:

```bash
docker run -itd --name ldaps --link directory:ldap \
    -e STUNNEL_SERVICE=ldaps \
    -e STUNNEL_ACCEPT=636 \
    -e STUNNEL_CONNECT=ldap:389 \
    -e "STUNNEL_CIPHERS=DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA"
    -p 636:636 \
    -v /etc/ssl/private/server.key:/etc/stunnel/stunnel.key:ro \
    -v /etc/ssl/private/server.crt:/etc/stunnel/stunnel.pem:ro \
    inveniem/stunnel
```

### Allow Local Insecure Clients to Connect to PSK-Secured Server
This example demonstrates how to connect to a service that as been secured with 
a pre-shared key (PSK):

```bash
docker run -itd \
    -e STUNNEL_CLIENT=yes \
    -e STUNNEL_SERVICE=myservice \
    -e STUNNEL_CONNECT=myservice.net:1234 \
    -e STUNNEL_ACCEPT=6379 \
    -e STUNNEL_PSK=/etc/stunnel/stunnel.psk \
    -v /etc/ssl/private/server.psk:/etc/stunnel/stunnel.psk:ro \
    -p 6379:6379 \
    inveniem/stunnel
```

    -e STUNNEL_PSK=/etc/stunnel/stunnel.psk \
    -v /etc/ssl/private/server.psk:/etc/stunnel/stunnel.psk:ro \
    -p 6379:6379 \
    inveniem/stunnel
```
